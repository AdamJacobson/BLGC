Blacklight Gear Calculator - Application for stat calculation for the game Blacklight Retribution by PerfectWorld Studios.

Blacklight Retribution is a first-person shooter online free-to-play game. Players can outfit their character, 
(refered to as an "Agent") with a variety of weapons. Each weapon consistes of several interchangable parts which
alter the agents' stats in various ways. 

There are hundreds of possible combinations of each weapon. However, the game itself does not possess a way
to compare different combinations side by side. The purpose of this application is to provide a way to do this.

Using easily editable and expandable XML files which describe each part, this program allows a user to preview
and compare side-by-side two different weapons as well as see their relative stat changes.
